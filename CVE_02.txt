Value[delimiter]Weight[delimiter]Description[delimiter]
Administrator[delimiter] 1.0[delimiter] The attacker gains access to an entity with administrator, root, SYSTEM, or equivalent privileges that imply full control over the software under analysis; or, the attacker can raise their own (lower) privileges to an administrator.[delimiter]
Partially-Privileged User[delimiter] 0.9[delimiter] The attacker gains access to an entity with some special privileges, but not enough privileges that are equivalent to an administrator; or, the attacker can raise their own (lower) privileges to a partially-privileged user. For example, a user might have privileges to make backups, but not to modify the software's configuration or install updates.[delimiter]
Regular User[delimiter] 0.7[delimiter] The attacker gains access to an entity that is a regular user who has no special privileges; or, the attacker can raise their own (lower) privileges to that of a regular user.[delimiter]
Limited / Guest[delimiter] 0.6[delimiter] The attacker gains access to an entity with limited or "guest" privileges that can significantly restrict allowable activities; or, the attacker can raise their own (lower) privileges to a guest. Note: this value does not refer to the "guest operating system" concept in virtualized hosts.[delimiter]
None[delimiter] 0.1[delimiter] The attacker cannot gain access to any extra privileges beyond those that are already available to the attacker. (Note that this value can be useful in limited circumstances in which the attacker can escape a sandbox or other restrictive environment but still cannot gain extra privileges, or obtain access as other users.)[delimiter]
Default[delimiter] 0.7[delimiter] Median of the weights for None, Guest, Regular User, Partially-Privileged User, and Administrator.[delimiter]
Unknown[delimiter] 0.5[delimiter] There is not enough information to provide a value for this factor. Further analysis may be necessary. In the future, a different value might be chosen, which could affect the score.[delimiter]
Not Applicable[delimiter] 1.0[delimiter] This factor is being intentionally ignored in the score calculation because it is not relevant to how the scorer prioritizes weaknesses. This factor might not be applicable in an environment with high assurance requirements that wants strict enforcement of privilege separation, even between already-privileged users.[delimiter]
Quantified[delimiter] [delimiter] This factor could be quantified with custom weights. Note that Quantified values are supported for completeness; however, since privileges and users are discrete entities, there might be limited circumstances in which a quantified model would be useful.[delimiter]
